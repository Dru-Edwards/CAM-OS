# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The CAM-OS team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please email [security@cam-os.dev](mailto:EdwardsTechPros@Outlook.com) with a description of the issue, the steps you took to create it, affected versions, and if known, mitigations. We will respond as quickly as possible to address the issue.

- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and forensics

### Threat Model

#### Assets
- Cognitive syscall interface
- Memory context data
- Driver ecosystem
- Federation synchronization
- Marketplace transactions

#### Threats
