## Security Architecture

### CAM Trust Envelope
CAM-OS implements a comprehensive security architecture called the "CAM Trust Envelope" that provides:

- **Zero Trust Networking**: All communications require authentication and authorization
- **Hardware Security**: TPM 2.0 integration for root of trust
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Future-proof against quantum computing threats
- **Process Isolation**: Sandboxed execution for drivers and untrusted code
- **Audit Trails**: Comprehensive logging for compliance and forensics

### Threat Model

#### Protected Assets
- Cognitive syscall interface
- Memory context data
- Driver ecosystem
- Federation synchronization
- Marketplace transactions

#### Threat Mitigations
- Multi-factor authentication
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Driver manifest verification
- Certificate pinning
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

## Security Certifications
