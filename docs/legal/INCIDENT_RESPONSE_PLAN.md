# Incident Response Plan

*Last Updated: May 27, 2025*

## Purpose

This Incident Response Plan outlines the procedures for identifying, responding to, and recovering from security incidents affecting the Complete Arbitration Mesh (CAM Protocol) platform. It provides a structured approach to ensure timely and effective handling of security breaches, data leaks, service disruptions, and other security-related events.

## Scope

This plan applies to all systems, data, and services associated with the CAM Protocol, including:
- Core routing infrastructure
- Multi-agent collaboration platform
- Payment processing systems
- User authentication systems
- Data storage and processing systems

## Incident Response Team

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities | Contact |
|------|-----------------|---------|
| **Incident Response Manager** | Overall coordination of incident response activities | ir-manager@cam-protocol.com |
| **Security Analyst** | Technical investigation and containment | security@cam-protocol.com |
| **Communications Lead** | Internal and external communications | comms@cam-protocol.com |
| **Legal Counsel** | Legal and compliance guidance | legal@cam-protocol.com |
| **Technical Lead** | System restoration and technical remediation | tech@cam-protocol.com |

### Escalation Path

1. First responder identifies potential incident
2. Incident reported to Security Analyst
3. Security Analyst escalates to Incident Response Manager if confirmed
4. Incident Response Manager activates appropriate team members
5. CEO and Board notified for critical incidents (Severity 1)

## Incident Classification

| Severity | Description | Examples | Response Time |
|----------|-------------|----------|---------------|
| **1 - Critical** | Significant impact on critical systems, sensitive data breach, or widespread service outage | - Data breach exposing customer PII<br>- Complete service outage<br>- Compromise of authentication systems | Immediate (< 15 min) |
| **2 - High** | Significant impact on important systems or limited impact on critical systems | - Partial service outage<br>- Compromise of non-production systems<br>- Targeted attack affecting limited users | < 1 hour |
| **3 - Medium** | Limited impact on important systems or significant impact on non-critical systems | - Performance degradation<br>- Suspicious activity<br>- Minor configuration issues | < 4 hours |
| **4 - Low** | Limited impact on non-critical systems | - Isolated anomalies<br>- Policy violations<br>- Failed attack attempts | < 24 hours |

## Incident Response Phases

### 1. Preparation

* Maintain current incident response plan
* Conduct regular security training for all staff
* Implement monitoring and alerting systems
* Establish secure communication channels
* Prepare incident response toolkit
* Document system configurations and baselines

### 2. Detection and Analysis

* Monitor security alerts and logs
* Investigate suspicious activities
* Determine incident scope and impact
* Classify incident severity
* Document initial findings
* Establish incident timeline

#### Detection Sources
* Security monitoring tools
* Automated alerts
* User reports
* Third-party notifications
* Anomaly detection systems

### 3. Containment

#### Immediate Containment
* Isolate affected systems
* Block malicious IP addresses
* Disable compromised accounts
* Preserve evidence and logs
* Implement emergency access controls

#### Short-term Containment
* Deploy additional monitoring
* Apply temporary patches or workarounds
* Implement additional authentication measures
* Enhance logging for affected systems

#### Long-term Containment
* Apply permanent patches
* Rebuild compromised systems
* Update security controls
* Implement architectural improvements

### 4. Eradication

* Remove malware and unauthorized access
* Address vulnerabilities that were exploited
* Validate security of all affected systems
* Enhance security controls
* Perform security scans and penetration testing

### 5. Recovery

* Restore systems to normal operation
* Monitor for suspicious activity
* Gradually restore services based on priority
* Validate data integrity
* Implement additional security controls
* Perform security testing before full restoration

### 6. Post-Incident Activities

* Conduct detailed post-mortem analysis
* Document lessons learned
* Update incident response procedures
* Implement preventive measures
* Provide additional training if needed
* Update risk assessment

## Communication Plan

### Internal Communication

* Use secure communication channels
* Regular status updates to management
* Technical briefings for IT staff
* Documentation of all communications

### External Communication

#### Customer Communication
* Notification timeline based on severity and legal requirements
* Clear explanation of impact and remediation
* Regular updates on service status
* Dedicated support channels

#### Regulatory Notification
* GDPR breach notification (within 72 hours if applicable)
* Industry-specific regulatory notifications
* Documentation of all regulatory communications

#### Public Relations
* Prepared statements for different scenarios
* Single point of contact for media inquiries
* Coordination with legal before any public statements

## Data Breach Response Procedures

### Assessment
1. Determine what data was compromised
2. Identify affected individuals
3. Assess risk of harm to affected individuals
4. Document breach details and timeline

### Notification
1. Prepare notification content with legal review
2. Establish notification method (email, mail, website)
3. Set up dedicated support channels for affected individuals
4. Document all notification activities

### Remediation
1. Offer appropriate remediation (credit monitoring, identity protection)
2. Establish claims process if applicable
3. Track remediation effectiveness
4. Document all remediation activities

## Testing and Maintenance

* Quarterly review and update of this plan
* Annual tabletop exercises for different scenarios
* Technical drills for response team
* Post-incident review and plan updates
* Integration with business continuity planning

## Compliance Requirements
