# Vulnerability Disclosure Policy

*Last Updated: May 27, 2025*

## 1. Introduction

At Complete Arbitration Mesh ("CAM Protocol", "we", "our", or "us"), security is a top priority. We believe that working with the security research community is crucial in identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in our systems. This Vulnerability Disclosure Policy outlines our commitment to security and provides guidelines for security researchers to report vulnerabilities responsibly.

## 2. Purpose and Scope

### 2.1 Purpose

The purpose of this policy is to:
- Provide clear guidelines for security researchers to report vulnerabilities
- Define our commitment to addressing security vulnerabilities
- Establish a framework for responsible disclosure
- Protect both security researchers and our users

### 2.2 Scope

This policy applies to:

#### 2.2.1 In-Scope Systems
- cam-protocol.com and all subdomains
- CAM Protocol API endpoints
- CAM Protocol client libraries and SDKs
- CAM Protocol mobile applications
- CAM Protocol documentation sites

#### 2.2.2 Out-of-Scope Systems
- Third-party services not owned by CAM Protocol
- Physical security vulnerabilities
- Social engineering attacks
- Denial of service attacks
- Spam or automated scanning tools

## 3. Safe Harbor

We consider security research conducted under this policy to be:
- Authorized in accordance with the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)
- Exempt from DMCA prohibitions on circumvention of technological measures
- Exempt from restrictions in our Terms of Service that would otherwise prohibit testing

To qualify for Safe Harbor, you must:
- Make a good faith effort to avoid privacy violations, data destruction, service disruption, and degradation of user experience
- Only interact with accounts you own or have explicit permission to access
- Not exploit a security issue for purposes other than verification
- Report vulnerabilities directly to us and not disclose to others until we have had a reasonable time to address them
- Provide us reasonable time to remediate vulnerabilities before any disclosure

## 4. Reporting a Vulnerability

### 4.1 Reporting Channels

Security researchers can report vulnerabilities through the following channels:
- Email: security@cam-protocol.com
- HackerOne program: hackerone.com/cam-protocol
- Encrypted email using our PGP key (available on our security page)

### 4.2 Information to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any supporting materials (screenshots, proof of concept code, etc.)
- Your contact information for follow-up questions

### 4.3 Reporting Format

To help us triage and prioritize submissions, we recommend using the following format:

```
Summary: Brief description of the vulnerability

Vulnerability Type: e.g., XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection

Severity: Critical/High/Medium/Low

Description: Detailed description of the issue

Reproduction Steps:
1. Step one
2. Step two
3. ...

Impact: What could an attacker do with this vulnerability

Suggested Mitigation: Optional suggestions for fixing the issue

Supporting Material: Links to screenshots, PoC code, etc.
```

## 5. Our Commitments

### 5.1 Response Timeline

We are committed to the following response timeline:
- Initial acknowledgment: Within 24 hours
- Triage and severity assessment: Within 3 business days
- Regular updates on remediation progress: At least every 5 business days
- Resolution timeframe based on severity:
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 90 days

### 5.2 Vulnerability Assessment

We assess vulnerabilities based on the following criteria:
- Exploitability (how easy it is to exploit)
- Impact (what damage could result)
- Affected users (how many users are affected)
- Data sensitivity (what type of data is at risk)

### 5.3 Communication

We commit to:
- Clear and transparent communication throughout the process
- Acknowledging your report and providing updates
- Notifying you when the vulnerability has been fixed
- Requesting your feedback on our handling of the report

## 6. Recognition and Rewards

### 6.1 Public Recognition

With your permission, we will recognize your contribution in:
- Our security hall of fame
- Security advisories related to the vulnerability
- Release notes when the fix is deployed

### 6.2 Bug Bounty Program

We maintain a bug bounty program with rewards based on the severity of the vulnerability:

| Severity | Reward Range |
|----------|--------------|
| Critical | $5,000 - $10,000 |
| High     | $2,000 - $5,000 |
| Medium   | $500 - $2,000 |
| Low      | $100 - $500 |

Rewards are determined based on:
- Severity of the vulnerability
- Quality of the report
- Potential impact on users
- Novelty of the finding

## 7. Disclosure Policy

### 7.1 Coordinated Disclosure

We practice coordinated disclosure:
- We request that you do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a reasonable time to address it
- We will work with you to determine an appropriate disclosure timeline
- We aim to fix vulnerabilities within 90 days of verification

### 7.2 Public Disclosure

After a vulnerability has been fixed:
- We will publish a security advisory if the vulnerability affects a significant number of users
- We will credit you for the discovery (with your permission)
- We encourage you to publish your findings after we have released a fix

## 8. Legal Guidelines

### 8.1 Authorized Testing Activities

The following activities are authorized under this policy:
