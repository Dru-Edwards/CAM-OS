- [ ] Chief Technology Officer (CTO)
- [ ] VP of Engineering
- [ ] Security Lead
- [ ] Compliance Officer

## Current Status

As of May 27, 2025, the following items are in progress:
- Penetration testing (scheduled for June 10, 2025)
- OWASP Top 10 vulnerability assessment
- Security sign-off

All other items will be tracked in this document as they are completed. Until these outstanding tasks are resolved, the platform should be considered not fully hardened.
