## What is Complete Arbitration Mesh?

Complete Arbitration Mesh is a unified platform that combines:

1. **CAM Classic**: Intelligent AI workload routing across multiple providers
2. **IACP (Inter-Agent Collaboration Protocol)**: Advanced multi-agent collaboration capabilities

## Key Features

### Routing Capabilities (CAM Classic)
- FastPath routing for optimal provider selection
- Policy-driven governance with OPA integration
- Cost optimization and performance balancing
- Real-time monitoring and analytics
- Enterprise-grade security and compliance

### Collaboration Capabilities (IACP)
- Agent discovery and capability matching
- Task decomposition and workflow orchestration
- Role-based collaboration with secure messaging
- Collaborative problem-solving frameworks
- Agent marketplace integration

## Architecture Principles

- **Backward Compatibility**: 100% compatible with existing CAM implementations
- **Unified Infrastructure**: Shared authentication, monitoring, and configuration
- **Extensible Design**: Plugin architecture for custom providers and agents
- **Enterprise Ready**: Security, compliance, and scalability built-in
- **Performance Optimized**: Sub-100ms routing decisions, high-throughput collaboration
