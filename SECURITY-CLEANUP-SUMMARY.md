# Security Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the security cleanup performed on the CAM-OS repository to make it safe for public consumption.

## ✅ Files Removed

### Internal Documentation
- `HARDENING-SPRINT.md` - Contained internal security ticket details (H-1 through H-10)
- `scripts/safe-push.sh` - Internal workflow script with security scanning details

### Rationale
These files contained internal security processes, ticket numbering systems, and implementation details that could provide attackers with insights into the security posture and potential vulnerabilities.

## 🔒 Enhanced Security

### Updated .gitignore
Added comprehensive patterns to prevent future commits of:
- Certificates and private keys (`*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.crt`, `*.p12`)
- Configuration files with secrets (`*.env`, `config/dev.yaml`)
- Payment provider credentials (`stripe_*.json`, `paypal_*.json`)
- Internal documentation (`*Hardening*`, `Safe*`)
- Build artifacts and coverage files
- Kubernetes secrets (`*secret*.yaml`)

### Sample Configuration
- Created `config/dev.sample.yaml` as a secure template
- Removed hardcoded values and added security guidance
- Developers can copy and customize without exposing secrets

## 📝 Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Removed explicit hardening ticket references (H-1, H-2, etc.)
- Removed links to internal security documentation
- Fixed syscall name typo (`sys_tmp_sign` corrected)
- Maintained high-level security overview without implementation details

### CI/CD Workflow
- Kept security scanning functionality
- Removed internal hardening validation references
- Maintained SBOM generation and sensitive file detection

## 🏷️ Version Tagging

- Tagged current state as `v2.0.0-clean`
- This serves as a clean baseline for public distribution
- Future forks can align with this cleaned version

## 🚫 Files That Don't Exist (Good!)

The following sensitive files mentioned in the security audit were not found in the repository:
- `docs/blueprints/Safe Push Workflow & Hardening TODOs.md`
- `deployment/kubernetes/operator/samples/cam-secret.yaml`
- `internal/marketplace/stripe_keys_test.json`
- `internal/marketplace/paypal_keys_test.json`
- `scripts/tpm_fake_cert.pem`
- `docs/legal/ENTERPRISE_LICENSE.pdf`
- `tests/fuzz/corpus/*` (bulky files)
- `coverage/*.out`, `*.prof` files

## ✅ Repository Status

The repository is now clean and safe for public consumption:
- ✅ No sensitive credentials or certificates
- ✅ No internal security processes exposed
- ✅ No hardcoded secrets or development configurations
- ✅ Comprehensive .gitignore prevents future issues
- ✅ Sample configurations provided for developers
- ✅ Security scanning still enabled in CI/CD

## 📋 Best Practices Going Forward

1. **Always use sample configs** - Never commit real configuration files
2. **Review .gitignore** - Ensure sensitive patterns are covered
3. **Use environment variables** - For runtime secrets and configuration
4. **Regular security scans** - CI/CD will catch sensitive files
5. **Private documentation** - Keep internal security details in private repos

## 🔍 Verification

To verify the cleanup was successful:
```bash
# Check for sensitive files
find . -name "*.pem" -o -name "*.key" -o -name "*.env" | grep -v .git

# Check for hardening references
grep -r "H-[0-9]" . --exclude-dir=.git

# Verify .gitignore coverage
git check-ignore config/dev.yaml  # Should be ignored
```
