## Implementation Guidelines

### Development Phases
Each blueprint is organized around the four-phase development roadmap:

1. **Phase 1: Core Enhancement** (Weeks 1-2)
   - Kernel architecture refinement
   - Enhanced syscall implementation
   - Security framework hardening

2. **Phase 2: Driver Ecosystem** (Weeks 3-4)
   - gRPC framework completion
   - WASM runtime integration
   - Driver manifest system

3. **Phase 3: Observability** (Weeks 5-6)
   - OpenTelemetry integration
   - Explainability engine completion
   - Compliance framework implementation

4. **Phase 4: Production Hardening** (Weeks 7-8)
   - Performance optimization
   - Formal verification
   - Security audit preparation

### Design Principles

- **Microkernel Architecture**: Minimize kernel complexity, maximize modularity
- **Post-Quantum Ready**: All cryptographic operations must be quantum-resistant
- **Explainable by Design**: Every decision must be auditable and explainable
- **Performance First**: <1ms syscall latency, >10K ops/sec throughput
- **Cloud Native**: Kubernetes-first deployment with edge compatibility

### Documentation Standards

Each blueprint follows this structure:
1. **Overview** - High-level component description
2. **Architecture** - Detailed technical design
3. **Interface Specification** - APIs, protocols, and data formats
4. **Implementation Plan** - Step-by-step development approach
5. **Performance Requirements** - Latency, throughput, and resource targets
6. **Security Considerations** - Threat model and mitigations
7. **Testing Strategy** - Validation and verification approach

## Getting Started

1. Review the [kernel-architecture.md](kernel-architecture.md) for overall system design
2. Examine component-specific blueprints based on your development focus
3. Follow implementation plans in sequential order
4. Validate against performance requirements and security considerations

## Contributing

When adding new blueprints:
1. Follow the documentation standards outlined above
2. Ensure alignment with the CAM-OS specification
3. Include detailed implementation guidance
4. Provide performance benchmarks and security analysis
