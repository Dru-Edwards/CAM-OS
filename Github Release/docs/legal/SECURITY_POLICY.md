## Risk Management

### Risk Assessment Process

CAM Protocol conducts regular risk assessments following these steps:
1. Asset identification and classification
2. Threat and vulnerability identification
3. Risk analysis and evaluation
4. Risk treatment and mitigation
5. Monitoring and review

### Risk Treatment

Risks are addressed through one or more of the following approaches:
- Risk mitigation through security controls
- Risk transfer through insurance or third-party services
- Risk acceptance with appropriate documentation and approval
- Risk avoidance by eliminating the risk source

## Asset Management

### Asset Classification

All information assets are classified according to their sensitivity:
- Public: Information that can be freely disclosed
- Internal: Information for internal use only
- Confidential: Sensitive information requiring protection
- Restricted: Highly sensitive information with strict access controls

### Asset Handling

Each classification level has specific handling requirements for:
- Access control
- Storage and transmission
- Backup and recovery
- Retention and disposal

## Access Control

### Access Control Principles

CAM Protocol implements access controls based on:
- Principle of least privilege
- Need-to-know basis
- Separation of duties
- Defense in depth

### User Access Management

The following processes are in place for managing user access:
- Formal user registration and de-registration
- Privileged access management
- Regular access rights review
- Password management and multi-factor authentication
- Just-in-time access for administrative functions

## Cryptography

### Cryptographic Controls

CAM Protocol implements cryptographic controls for:
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Key management and protection
