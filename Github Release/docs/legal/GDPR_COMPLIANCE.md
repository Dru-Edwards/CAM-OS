# GDPR Compliance Framework

*Last Updated: May 27, 2025*

## Introduction

This document outlines the Complete Arbitration Mesh (CAM Protocol) framework for compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). It serves as a guide for our organization to ensure that all processing of personal data of European Union (EU) data subjects is conducted in accordance with GDPR requirements.

## Scope

This framework applies to all processing of personal data of EU data subjects, regardless of whether the processing takes place in the EU or not. It covers all systems, applications, processes, and departments within CAM Protocol that process personal data.

## Data Protection Principles

CAM Protocol adheres to the following GDPR principles in all personal data processing activities:

1. **Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency**: We process personal data lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner.
2. **Purpose Limitation**: We collect personal data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes.
3. **Data Minimization**: We ensure personal data is adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary.
4. **Accuracy**: We maintain accurate and up-to-date personal data.
5. **Storage Limitation**: We keep personal data for no longer than necessary.
6. **Integrity and Confidentiality**: We process personal data securely.
7. **Accountability**: We demonstrate compliance with these principles.
